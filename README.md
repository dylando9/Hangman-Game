## Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple command line hangman game built with Python.

## How to Use
Simply press run on the main.py module and start playing! The computer will randomly select a word from a generated list. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. If not, you lose a life and the hangman begins to be drawn, part by part.

You have 6 lives to try guessing the full word correctly before the full hangman is drawn and you lose the game.

The game ends when you guess the full word correctly or when you use up all 6 lives (the full hangman is drawn).
